##Ludum Dare #28

**Theme: You Only Get One**

##Controls:
 - wasd moves
 - space jumps
 - x fires

##Concept
 - one dimension, one command, one item?
 - 
###Visual:
 - 400x240 at 2x for pixely goodness
 - roughly 3x60px areas, plus 1x60 footer/statusbar.
  - Unless I find a use for the footer, get rid of it?   

##Todo
 - Creatures working [maybe working?]
  - multiple creatures[kinda], 
  - collision.... [working]
 - STRONGER CONCEPT!
 - more maps
 - Sound effects
 - Music?

##Done
 - Can declare collidable areas in maps, can declare animated things. 
 - Menu can activate other scenes.
